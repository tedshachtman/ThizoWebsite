            <h2>A few words on the future of Design from our CEO.</h2>
            <p>How can we add value to the Design process while upholding values and workflow that make up our industry? After decades in the industry, and being fed up with both stagnant technology development as well as consistent operations pains across projects and geography, our team decided to solve this pain point. It was the middle of 2024 and instead of squeezing the creative time into our project schedules, minimalizing time requirements, and buttering up contractors to buffer the budget with few change-orders, we've created a technology to solve our biggest challenge; time. Welcome to Thizo! We're glad you are open to integrating this operations technology to your practice.</p>

            <h3>The Intersection of Design and Technology</h3>
            <p>For centuries, Architects, Engineers, and Designers have dreamed, drawn, and erected spaces for us to learn, work, live, heal, and play based on the newest technologies available to us. We research new materials and learn the latest codes, integrate drawing tools, encompass BIM best practices. Today, we're using technology again to amplify our practice. This time, it's not a keystone with flying buttresses, or completing drawings via clicks on a computer screen. Thizo is today's best technology. Thizo is built to turbo charge your operations. To empower your team to focus on the creative, the safety, the communication, and the details rather than nuanced documentation. Let the technology to the nuanced work and give yourself the gift of empowerment.</p>

            <h3>The People Who Build the World</h3>
            <p>Few industries understand the art and science of great spaces. They may understand the financing of development projects, or how to construct via the drawings. But we believe our industry deserves the best technology too. We believe we can empower our industry to specialize, to uplift their own practices, to grow and advance the industry at-large, if we have technology complete the work that yesterday, "weighed us down".</p>

            <h3>The Journey Ahead</h3>
            <p>Yes, new technology can seem scary. Change is scary. And our team is doing our best to make it as seamless and easy as possible. Perfection will not happen immediately. But together, we can bringe technology into our practices and boost the industry at-lrage.</p>
